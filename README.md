Hi. Changed so it's not public for different, explainable reasons. I'm still (only) interested in you.

If you haven't,

M!!!!!!!!!M!!!@protonmail.com / B[rest lowercase, something about lines][Last two digits of 'your' number]

Hope you're all ok.

Back in (through 'resetting' e@) but lost data (long story).
If I didn't? share it there's more on Twitter (j... some stuff to inform you when I couldn't get on here, or actively d...).
Still emailed a lot to a different PM account but explicably stopped around a month ago.
Would've made it more accessible but 20/80 rule because a lot of other stuff and this, as mich as I want/ed to connect, unclear.
Hope you're doing ok skattje.

The above is full. :S Sent too many images. I'll make a new one that's the same but MM2 tomorrow? If I can remember the password. Hope everyone and -thing is ok. If not, I'll let you know here what it could be.

Ok 'your' new account is at the same place, but

l: O......T..L....!1  
p: M.....!2

Where

- l is Capitalized (like everyth.. ok, saved for later) and not E but closer to home, since I can't remember and or access how you wrote it right now

- !1 are last two digits of 'my' number and !2 of yours and

- p is a 'concat(enation)' (think that's what it's called) of the last l

(Know to make things harder than they have to be... but you knew that going in... and no that's not a sex.... not this time! Except if you're... then that's exactly what it is, etc).

We'd find much better, more removed lines with priority. Added meaning alert. :O

Hope that makes sense and that you're all ok.
